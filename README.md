### Core of the Application

At the core of the application, there are three REST services: __flight__ , **reservation**, and **customer**. Each service performs the standard CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) within its specific context:

- **Flight Service**: Manages flight information and schedules.
- **Reservation Service**: Handles booking and reservation details.
- **Customer Service**: Manages customer profiles and information.

For the creation of these REST services, several cloud-native application development methodologies were followed, including:

- **API First**: Designing APIs before implementing the services to ensure a clear contract and better collaboration.
- **One Codebase â€“ One Application**: Maintaining a single codebase per service to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.
- **Dependency Management**: Using tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies efficiently.

The primary technology used is **Spring Boot**, leveraging its powerful features for building robust and scalable REST services. For API documentation, the **OpenAPI Specification** was used, providing a standard way to describe the APIs and enabling easy integration with tools like Swagger for interactive API documentation.

#### Swagger UI
Below are screenshots of the Swagger UI for the REST services:

### Configurations

Spring Cloud Config is used to **externalize the application configuration**, adhering to the principles of cloud-native applications, such as the Twelve-Factor App methodology. This approach allows for centralized management of configuration properties, making the application more flexible and easier to manage across different environments. Additionally, some endpoints offered by the **Spring Actuator module** are utilized to dynamically update configurations in the microservices. The configuration files are stored in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/johndlr/airline-config), which is connected to the Config Server to provide version-controlled configuration management.

As a simple example, below is a screenshot showing the Eureka server configurations that have been loaded from the GitHub repository by the Config Server:

### Discovery Service

The discovery service is implemented using **Spring Cloud Eureka Server**. Eureka Server acts as a registry for microservices, enabling them to discover and communicate with each other without hardcoding their locations. This dynamic service discovery mechanism is crucial for maintaining the flexibility and scalability of a microservices architecture.

By registering with Eureka, each microservice provides its metadata, such as host and port, health indicator URL, and other service-specific information. Eureka clients, which are the microservices themselves, use this registry to look up other services and make remote procedure calls (RPCs) to them.

The use of Eureka Server simplifies the management of service instances, supports load balancing, and enhances fault tolerance by rerouting requests to healthy instances in case of failures.

Below is a screenshot of the discovery service running:

### Inter-Service Communication

To facilitate communication between services, **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** is used for synchronous communication, and **Kafka** is used for asynchronous communication.

#### Synchronous Communication

The **Reservation** service uses Feign clients to fetch information from the **Flight** and **Customer** services. This allows the Reservation service to gather all necessary details to create a complete reservation.

#### Asynchronous Communication

For asynchronous communication, **Kafka** and **Spring Cloud Stream** are used to connect the **Reservation** service with a new service called **Message**. The Message service uses **Spring Cloud Function** to send an email to the customer when a reservation is made. The email functionality is implemented using **Spring Mail**, **SMTP Gmail**, and **JavaMailSender**.

Below is the general scheme of asynchronous communication between the message and reservation services:

#### Kafka Topics

To facilitate asynchronous communication between services, Kafka topics are used. Two topics were successfully created:

- **send_communication**: This topic is used to send messages from the **Reservation** service to the **Message** service, indicating that a reservation has been made and an email needs to be sent to the customer.
- **communication_sent**: This topic is used by the **Message** service to notify the **Reservation** service that the email has been successfully sent. Upon receiving this notification, the Reservation service updates the `communication_switch` column in the reservations table.

These topics enable reliable and scalable communication between services, ensuring that messages are delivered and processed asynchronously.

#### Email sending logic in action

When creating a new reservation, the event to send an email is triggered:

<h3>Implementing security in the application</h3>
<p>
  To implement application security, the OAuth2 protocol was used for authorization, OpenID Connect for authentication, and Keycloak for Identity and Access Management (IAM) processes.
  
  The OAuth2 authorization flow chosen for implementation in the application is the client credentials type.
  
  The Edge Server was established as the resource server, and Keycloak as the authorization server.
  
  Within the Edge Server, permissions were configured based on roles.
  
  In the application context, there are 3 application users:

  * Airline Call Center, with the roles RESERVATION, CUSTOMER, FLIGHT, the user with all permissions, meaning they can create flights, customers, and reservations.
  * Airline Customer Operators, with the only role CUSTOMER, this user is limited to managing airline customers.
  * Airline Flight Operators, with the only role FLIGHT, this user is limited to managing airline flights."

  For this documentation, some tests performed on the flight service using the three application users are presented.

  <br/>

  Airline Customer Operators, access credentials provided to Postman and the corresponding response

  <div><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d530df9-5e37-4397-a536-e9ab0027260f" alt="project-screenshot"></div>
  <br/>

  Airline Flight Operators, access credentials provided to Postman and the corresponding response
  <div><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be428abc-90b5-4919-9e51-f82e5e467683" alt="project-screenshot"></div>
  <div><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b807d156-b2eb-4c2d-9c57-2e98e3b02f22" alt="project-screenshot"></div>
  <br/>

  In all three cases, the behavior is as expected. The role-based authorization system is functioning correctly.
