<h1 align="center" id="title">üõ¨ Airline Microservices Application üõ´</h1>

<p id="description">The application based on a microservices architecture works as a registration for flights, customers and reservations system for a fictitious airline.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>
<h3>Three services were created: flight, customer and reservation, each one exposes different endpoints for CRUD functions.</h3>
<h4>Flight Service ‚úàÔ∏è</h4>
<p>Manages all the information related to an airline flight</p>

<h4>How do they communicate?</h4>

<p>Spring Cloud OpenFeign was used to communicate the reservation service with the other two services. In this way, complete reservation information is obtained, as well as flight and client data.</p>
<h3>Service Discovery</h3>
<p>Spring Cloud Eureka Server was used for the discovery service.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud Gateway was used as an edge server, taking advantage of the default load balancer.</p>

<h3>Config Server</h3>
<p>Spring Cloud Config is used to externalize the application configuration, and some endpoints offered by the Spring Actuator module are also used to update configurations in microservices. Finally, a Github repository was used to store the different configuration files and connect it to the Config Server.</p>

<h3>Async Communication using RabbitMQ</h3>
<p>To achieve asynchronous communication between the reservation and message services, spring cloud stream, spring cloud function and rabbitmq were used. A new service called Message was created, which simulates sending an email and SMS when creating a new reservation. The general scheme is as follows:</p>

<br/>
<p>In rabbitmq the queues were registered successfully</p>

<h3>Async Communication using Kafka</h3>
<p>With the help of Spring Cloud Stream, the application was reconfigured to now use Kafka as a message broker, configurations were added to the Reservation and Message services.</p>
<p>Before executing the business logic of the Reservation and Message services, the Kafka broker had the following information:</p>

<br/>
<p>After executing this logic, the messages were successfully received and processed:</p>
